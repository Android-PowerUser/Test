If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

##### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a problem that the app is slower in the background than in the foreground (branch Faster_background_speed).

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch System_message_handover). The current workaround is to go from the home screen.
