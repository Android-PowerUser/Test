## Screen Operator           (In development stage)

This app is intended to operate the screen with AI and is still in development

### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a bug that caused that if you switch the LLM you must go back and in again (branch Gem-change-LLM).

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch open_apps_attempt_2).

Correct implementation of MediaProjection (Create screenshots for Gemini). Almost finished code in the screenshot branch. The current workaround is to trigger a screenshot via the accessibility service. However, this leads to the thumbnail.
